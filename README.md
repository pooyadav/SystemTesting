# SystemTesting
This repo list how to do a system design and testing. 
We list different types of software tests:
1. Load testing: to understand the behaviour of the system under a specific expected load. In databox context - there are x number of
apps with y number of drivers and with z number of datastores.
2. Stress testing: maximum load. 
3. Soak/endurance testing: performance degration under continuous load.
4. Spike testing: sudden increase or decrease of load
5. Configuration testing: effects of change in configuration.
6. Isolation testing: re-execution of problematic test.
7. Scalability testing: performance testing parameter that investigates a system's ability to grow by increasing 
   the workload per user, or the number of concurrent users, or the size of a database, response time, throughput time, 
   hits per second, request per seconds, transaction per seconds, performance measurement with number of users,
   performance measurement under huge load, CPU usage, memory usage while testing in progress, network usage - 
   data sent and received, web server - request and response per second
8. Volume testing:  system performance with respect to database size.
